# Endorsement
> The UHM team has been in close connection with the local STEM community and participated in various STEM events, including the annual STEM festival hosted by the Girl Scouts of Hawai’i, the NSA/NSF GenCyber Camps, and other K-12 outreach programs hosted by the UH Office of Student Equity, Excellence, and Diversity, and Women in Technology. Recently, their preliminary designs of miniaturized harmonic radar tags and AI algorithms to track invasive pests like coconut rhino beetle in Hawaii were presented in the 2020 virtual STEM festival. The presentation incorporated an intuitive at-home experiment design for K-12 students to understand the physics of harmonic response. Being in a tropical island state whose natural biodiversity is particularly vulnerable to invasive species, I am very eager to see the future integration, deployment, and testing of their innovative approaches to facilitate our understanding, identification, and eradication of new invasive organisms...
