# Resource

## RF Research and Prototype
{{< gallery-enhance album="rf_research" numbered="true" caption="RF Research and Prototype">}}

- **mmWave Comm/Sensing/Sounder**: The customized 24-31GHz radio system implemented with a mmWave beamforming kit (BBox Lites/UD Box from TMYTEK), Ettus USRPs (N210, CDA-2990), and COTS Wi-Fi NICs (Intel 5300). The system consists of a 16-channel 24-31GHz phased array antenna and a frequency Up/Down converter, which interfaces with baseband devices (LabVIEW controlled USRPs or COTS Wi-Fi NICs). Each channel provides $ 360^{\circ} $ phase shifter coverage with $ 5^{\circ} $ per step, 400 ms beam switching time. The 3dB beam aperture is $ 13^{\circ} $ horizontally and $ 14^{\circ} $ vertically. The angle coverage is +/-$ 45^{\circ} $ horizontally and +/-$ 60^{\circ} $ vertically. The baseband devices can support up to 80MHz bandwidth with 64 subcarriers for data transmission or CSI measurements.

- **Ansys HFSS**: HFSS is a commercial finite element method solver for electromagnetic structures from Ansys. The acronym stands for high-frequency structure simulator. HFSS is one of several commercial tools used for antenna design, and the design of complex radio frequency electronic circuit elements including filters, transmission lines, and packaging.

## Instruments and Fabrications

{{< gallery-enhance album="instruments and fabrication" numbered="true" caption="Instruments and Fabrications">}}

- **Spectrum Analyzers (Keysight N9010B, N9918A)**: The benchtop model (Keysight N9010B) operates from 10Hz to 7GHz and is upgraded with a pre-amplifier and 40MHz analysis bandwidth. The handheld model (Keysight N9918A) operates from 30kHz to 26.5GHz and is upgraded with vector network analysis functions.
- **Signal Generators (Keysight 33210A)**: One basic signal generator for primary waveforms and 8K points of complex arbitrary waveforms.
- **Oscilloscopes (Keysight DSOX1102G)**: One basic oscilloscope operates up to
    100 MHz, 50,000 wfms/sec update rate.
- **Power Supplies (Keysight E36313A)**: One low noise power supply (ripple and
    noise $ < $ 350 $\mu$Vrms) with 4-wire sense to improve measurement accuracy.
- **Multimeter (Fluke 45)**: One basic digital multimeter with dual display,
    standard rs-232c interface, and dB measurement.
