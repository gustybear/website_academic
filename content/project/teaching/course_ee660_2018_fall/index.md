Fundamental understanding of computer architecture is key to hardware and processor design, compilers, operating systems, and high performance programming. This course explores computer architectures and design techniques of modern microprocessors at various scales. The focus will be given to architectures that can exploit different forms of parallelism, whether they be implicit or explicit, to improve performance. A selection of topics covered by the course include multi-issue superscalar processors, out-of-order processors, Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) processors, advanced caching, multiprocessor systems, and parallel programming.

The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of various processors will provide students a hand-on introduction to computer engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the computer processors that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.

## Grading Policy
| Homework | Labs | Discussion | Midterms     | Final |
|----------|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 25%      | 25%  | 10%        | 20%          | 20%   |


| A+   | A   | A-  | B+  | B   | B-  | C+  | C   | C-  | D+  | D   | D-  | F |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|---|
| 100% | 95% | 90% | 87% | 83% | 80% | 77% | 73% | 70% | 67% | 63% | 60% | 0 |


- *Homework*: You are encouraged to discuss homework assignments with your classmates and the course staff. Discussions may include general approaches to a problem, suggested resource material and whether your final answer is correct or not. However, each student must hand in their own implementation of the homework. **Copying of homework or code will result in a grade of zero for all parties involved**.

- *Labs*: In the lab you may work in teams of two. You may discuss the general approach to the lab assignment with other teams. However, each team must implement their own solution to the lab. Both team members must attend lab and sign-off. Each team must complete any pre-lab assignments individually and must submit them with their teams lab report. Duplication of code and/or data among teams will result in a grade of zero for all students involved.

- *Exams*: All exams are strictly individual efforts. Copying or otherwise cheating on an exam will result in a failing grade for the course.
