[^1]: Students may work in teams of two or three. each team will be assigned with one paper every other week. each team needs to complete two tasks on each paper: (1) give a in-depth presentation (60 min) and answer all the questions during the q&a (15 min); (2) write a one-page (excluding citations) summary of the paper (in ieee conference format).

[^2]: Students must work alone and complete the following tasks for each presentation: (1) prepare at least one relevent question for the presenter; (3) grade the presenter's presentation and report.
