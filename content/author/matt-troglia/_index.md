I am an doctoral student at the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. My research interests are in the domain of communications and network security.  I am currently studying  spectrum security in next generation specetrum sharing environments. Other areas of interest are in technologies for critical infrastructure security and privacy issues of web/mobile advertising.
