abstract: "The next-generation spectrum access system (SAS) for the Citizens Broadband\
  \ Radio Service band is equipped with environmental sensors (ESCs) to detect the\
  \ presence of non-informed incumbent users, which allows the SAS to dynamically\
  \ reassign spectrum resource for low privilege users to avoid interference. However,\
  \ the performance of existing single-node detection model is limited by the sensor's\
  \ geo-locations; whereas a naive distributed sensing network with improved detection\
  \ accuracy introduces a high bandwidth overhead due to the frequent communication\
  \ of spectrum data. In addition, many existing coherent spectrum sensing methods\
  \ are not feasible for CBRS band due to the unknown operational characteristics\
  \ of incumbent military wireless applications. To address these issues, we propose\
  \ a machine learning based non-coherent spectrum sensing system: (F)eder(a)ted (I)ncumbent\
  \ Detection in CB(R)S (FaIR). FaIR leverages a communication-efficient distributed\
  \ learning framework, federated learning, for ESCs to collaborate and train a data-driven\
  \ machine learning model for incumbent detection under minimal communication bandwidth.\
  \ Our preliminary results show that the federated learning method can exploit the\
  \ spatial diversity of ESCs and obtain an improved detection model comparing to\
  \ a naive distributed sensing and centralized model framework. We evaluate the FaIR\
  \ model with a variety of spectrum waveforms at varying SNRs. Our experiments showed\
  \ that FaIR improves the average detection accuracy compared to the single-node\
  \ method, using a fraction of the bandwidth compared to the naive multi-node method."
