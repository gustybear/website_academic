 abstract = {One deadly aspect of COVID-19 is that those infected can often be contagious before exhibiting overt symptoms. While methods such as temperature checks and sinus swabs have aided with early detection, the former does not always provide a reliable indicator of COVID-19, and the latter is invasive and requires significant human and material resources to administer. This paper presents a non-invasive COVID-19 early screening system implementable with commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The system leverages the Doppler radar principle to monitor respiratory-related chest motions and identify breathing rates that indicate COVID-19 infection. We developed the prototype with software-defined Wi- Fi radios, and evaluated the system performance with a robotic mover simulating human breathing, and on actual breathing, with a consistent respiratory rate accuracy better than one breath per minute, exceeding that for common medical practices.},
