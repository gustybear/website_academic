abstract: Future generation (FutureG) wireless communication systems are envisioned
  to explore the copious bandwidth at millimeter-wave bands with integrated joint
  communications and sensing (JCAS) to enhance network performance and augment human
  capabilities. The Channel State Information (CSI) provided through the channel estimation
  process enables the capture of fine-grained information on scatterers in the environment
  to discern minute physiological motion, such as heartbeat. This work presents the
  first heart signal detection via CSI from a millimeter-wave Orthogonal Frequency-Division
  Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. Trade-offs between using CSI amplitude and phase and
  the impact of frequency diversity are analyzed theoretically and confirmed experimentally
  using a 28 GHz OFDM communications system. Heart rates were successfully detected
  for three human subjects within 6% of photoplethysmography (PPG) reference, with
  clear benefits of frequency diversity among OFDM subcarriers.
