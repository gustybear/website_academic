abstract: Wireless communications systems provide channel state information (CSI),
  which can be used to characterize the physical propagation environment. The small
  physiological motion of human subjects in that environment, such as that associated
  with respiration, can modulate the CSI, thus allowing wireless physiological sensing
  through which a communications system detects and monitors cardiopulmonary motion.
  NextG millimeter-wave communications systems present even greater opportunities
  for wireless physiological sensing due to the advantages of small wavelength and
  high directionality. But challenges also arise due to the multipath effect and phase
  aliasing caused by larger-than-wavelength motion displacement. This work introduces
  a comprehensive mathematical CSI model to accurately characterize physiological
  motion captured by the amplitude and phase of the CSI of a millimeter-wave communications
  system. The model allows for the interpretation of intricate CSI pattern variations
  to avoid aliasing error and has been validated with experiments involving both parametric
  measures conducted with a robotic mover and respiration rate measurements for human
  subjects. In all cases, rate measurements could be consistently resolved within
  10%, or 0.02 Hz, demonstrating the potential for incorporating physiological sensing
  in NextG millimeter-wave communications systems.
