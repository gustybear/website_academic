  abstract = {Mobile apps nowadays are often packaged with third-party ad libraries to monetize user data. Many mobile ad networks exploit these mobile apps to extract sensitive real-time geographical data about the users for location-based targeted advertising. However, the massive collection of sensitive information by the ad networks has raised serious privacy concerns. Unfortunately, the extent and granularity of private data collection of the location-based ad networks remain obscure. In this work, we present a mobile tracking measurement study to characterize the severity and significance of location-based private data collection in mobile ad networks, by using an automated fine-grained data collection instrument running across different geographical areas. We perform extensive threat assessments for different ad networks using 1,100 popular apps running across 10 different cities. This study discovers that the number of location-based ads tend to be positively correlated with the population density of locations, ad networks' data collection behaviors differ across different locations, and most ad networks are capable of collecting precise location data. Detailed analysis further reveals the significant impact of geolocation on the tracking behavior of targeted ads, and a noteworthy security concern for advertising organizations to aggregate different types of private user data across multiple apps for a better targeted ad experience.},

In this work, we present a study of the potential privacy leakage in location-based mobile advertising services based on a large-scale measurement. We first introduce a threat model in the mobile ad ecosystem, and then design a measurement system to perform extensive threat measurements and assessments. To counteract the privacy leakage threats, we design and implement an adaptive location obfuscation mechanism, which can be used to obfuscate location data in real-time while minimizing the impact to mobile ad businesses.},

Recently, this unobtrusive form of physiological sensing has also been gaining attention for its potential for continuous identity authentication, which can reduce the vulnerability of traditional one-pass validation authentication systems. Physiological Doppler radar is an attractive approach for continuous identity authentication as it requires neither contact nor line-of-sight and does not give rise to privacy concerns associated with video imaging. This paper presents a review of recent advances in radar-based identity authentication systems. It includes an evaluation of the applicability of different research efforts in authentication using respiratory patterns and heart-based dynamics. It also identifies aspects of future research required to address remaining challenges in applying unobtrusive respiration-based or heart-based identity authentication to practical systems. With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, radar-based continuous authentication can grow to serve a wide range of valuable functions in society.},

Smart city applications focus on resolving issues facing people in everyday life, and have attracted a considerable amount of research interest. The typical issue encountered in such places of daily use, such as stations, shopping malls, and stadiums is crowd dynamics management. Therefore, we focus on crowd dynamics management to resolve the problem of congestion using IoT technologies. Real-time crowd dynamics management can be achieved by gathering information relating to congestion and propose less crowded places. Although many crowd dynamics management applications have been proposed in various scenarios and many models have been devised to this end, a general model for evaluating the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management has not yet been developed in IoT research. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to evaluate the performance of crowd dynamics management applications. In other words, the objective of this paper is to present the proof-of-concept of control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management. Our model uses feedback control theory, and enables an integrated evaluation of the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management methods under various scenarios. We also provide extensive numerical results to verify the effectiveness of the model.},

  abstract = {Personal health record (PHR) is an emerging patient-centric model of health information exchange, which is often outsourced to be stored at a third party, such as cloud providers. However, there have been wide privacy concerns as personal health information could be exposed to those third party servers and to unauthorized parties. To assure the patients' control over access to their own PHRs, it is a promising method to encrypt the PHRs before outsourcing. Yet, issues such as risks of privacy exposure, scalability in key management, flexible access, and efficient user revocation, have remained the most important challenges toward achieving fine-grained, cryptographically enforced data access control. In this paper, we propose a novel patient-centric framework and a suite of mechanisms for data access control to PHRs stored in semitrusted servers. To achieve fine-grained and scalable data access control for PHRs, we leverage attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques to encrypt each patient's PHR file. Different from previous works in secure data outsourcing, we focus on the multiple data owner scenario, and divide the users in the PHR system into multiple security domains that greatly reduces the key management complexity for owners and users. A high degree of patient privacy is guaranteed simultaneously by exploiting multiauthority ABE. Our scheme also enables dynamic modification of access policies or file attributes, supports efficient on-demand user/attribute revocation and break-glass access under emergency scenarios. Extensive analytical and experimental results are presented which show the security, scalability, and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Physical-layer key generation methods utilize the variations of the communication channel to achieve a secure key agreement between two parties with no prior security association. Their secrecy rate (bit generation rate) depends heavily on the randomness of the channel, which may reduce significantly in a stable environment. Existing methods seek to improve the secrecy rate by injecting artificial noise into the channel. Unfortunately, noise injection cannot alter the underlying channel state, which depends on the multipath environment between the transmitter and receiver. Consequently, these methods are known to leak key bits toward multi-antenna eavesdroppers, which is capable of filtering the noise through the differential of multiple signal receptions. This work demonstrates an improved approach to reinforce physical-layer key generation schemes, e.g., channel randomization. The channel randomization approach leverages a reconfigurable antenna to rapidly change the channel state during transmission, and an angle-of-departure (AoD) based channel estimation algorithm to cancel the changing effects for the intended receiver. The combined result is a communication channel stable in the eyes of the intended receiver but randomly changing from the viewpoint of the eavesdropper. We augmented an existing physical-layer key generation protocol, iJam, with the proposed approach and developed a full-fledged remote instrumentation platform to demonstrate its performance. Our evaluations show that augmentation does not affect the bit error rate (BER) of the intended receiver during key establishment but reduces the eavesdropper's BER to the level of random guessing, regardless of the number of antennas it equips.},

  abstract = {Orthogonal blinding based schemes for wireless physical layer security aim to achieve secure communication by injecting noise into channels orthogonal to the main channel and corrupting the eavesdropper's signal reception. These methods, albeit practical, have been proven vulnerable against multiantenna eavesdroppers who can filter the message from the noise. The vulnerability is rooted in the fact that the main channel state remains static in spite of the noise injection, which allows an eavesdropper to estimate it promptly via known symbols and filter out the noise. Our proposed scheme leverages a reconfigurable antenna for Alice to rapidly change the channel state during transmission and a compressive sensing based algorithm for her to predict and cancel the changing effects for Bob. As a result, the communication between Alice and Bob remains clear, whereas randomized channel state prevents Eve from launching the knownplaintext attack. We formally analyze the security of the scheme against both single and multi-antenna eavesdroppers and identify its unique anti-eavesdropping properties due to the artificially created fast-changing channel. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to evaluate its performance. Empirical results show that our scheme can suppress Eve's attack success rate to the level of random guessing, even if she knows all the symbols transmitted through other antenna modes.},

However, the performance of existing single-node detection model is limited by the sensor's geo-locations; whereas a naive distributed sensing network with improved detection accuracy introduces a high bandwidth overhead due to the frequent communication of spectrum data. In addition, many existing coherent spectrum sensing methods are not feasible for CBRS band due to the unknown operational characteristics of incumbent military wireless applications. To address these issues, we propose a machine learning based non-coherent spectrum sensing system: (F)eder(a)ted (I)ncumbent Detection in CB(R)S (FaIR). FaIR leverages a communication-efficient distributed learning framework, federated learning, for ESCs to collaborate and train a data-driven machine learning model for incumbent detection under minimal communication bandwidth. Our preliminary results show that the federated learning method can exploit the spatial diversity of ESCs and obtain an improved detection model comparing to a naive distributed sensing and centralized model framework. We evaluate the FaIR model with a variety of spectrum waveforms at varying SNRs. Our experiments showed that FaIR improves the average detection accuracy compared to the single-node method, using a fraction of the bandwidth compared to the naive multi-node method.},

Traditional detection techniques become less effective in identifying bots that communicate via a P2P structure. In this paper, we present PeerClean, a novel system that detects P2P botnets in real time using only high-level features extracted from C\&C network flow traffic. PeerClean reliably distinguishes P2P bot-infected hosts from legitimate P2P hosts by jointly considering flow-level traffic statistics and network connection patterns. Instead of working on individual connections or hosts, PeerClean clusters hosts with similar flow traffic statistics into groups. It then extracts the collective and dynamic connection patterns of each group by leveraging a novel dynamic group behavior analysis. Comparing with the individual host-level connection patterns, the collective group patterns are more robust and differentiable. Multi-class classification models are then used to identify different types of bots based on the established patterns. To increase the detection probability, we further propose to train the model with average group behavior, but to explore the extreme group behavior for the detection. We evaluate PeerClean on real-world flow records from a campus network. Our evaluation shows that PeerClean is able to achieve high detection rates with few false positives.},

Unfortunately, traditional network security solutions fall short of addressing the unique security requirements of the emerging environment given their general emphasis on administratively managed, preconfigured security context and strong physical security mechanisms. To cope with the security challenges of this emerging environment, novel cognitive-inspired security architectures have been proposed that emphasize dynamic, autonomous trust management. Cognitive security systems take advantage of sensing and computing capabilities of smart devices to analyze raw sensor data and apply machine learning techniques to make security decisions. In this article, we present a canonical representation of cognitive security architectures and examine the practicality of using these architectures to address the security challenges of rapidly growing networks of mobile/embedded autonomous devices including the ability to identify threats simply based on symptoms, without necessarily understanding attack methods. Using authentication as the main focus, we introduce our canonical representation and define various categories of contextual information commonly used by cognitive security architectures to handle authentication requirements, and highlight key advantages and disadvantages of each category. We then examine three grand challenges facing the cognitive security research including the tension between automation and security, the unintended consequences of using machine learning techniques as a basis for making security decisions, and the revocation problem in the context of cognitive security. We conclude by offering some insight into solution approaches to these challenges.},

Unfortunately, existing solutions usually reveal much of users' private location information during a proximity test. They are also vulnerable to location cheating where an attacker reports false locations to gain an advantage. Moreover, the initial trust establishment among unfamiliar users in large scale mobile social networks has been a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enables a user to perform (1) a location based handshake that establishes secure communications among strangers, who do not have a pre-shared secret, and (2) a privacy-preserving proximity test without revealing the user's actual location to the server or other users not within the proximity. The proposed scheme is based on a novel concept, i.e., spatial-temporal location tags, and we put forward a location tag construction method using environmental signals that provides an unforgeable location proof. We use Bloom filters to efficiently represent users' location tags and vicinity regions. We exploit fuzzy extractor, a lightweight cryptographic primitive, to extract shared secrets between matching location tags. We conduct extensive analysis, simulation, and real experiments to demonstrate the feasibility, security, and efficiency of our scheme.},

  abstract = {Data privacy is a globally recognized human right for individuals to control the access to their personal information, and bar the negative consequences from the use of this information. As communication technologies progress, the means to protect data privacy must also evolve to address new challenges come into view. Our research goal in this dissertation is to develop privacy protection frameworks and techniques suitable for the emerging cloud-based data services, in particular privacy-preserving algorithms and protocols for the cloud-based data sharing and data analytics services. Cloud computing has enabled users to store, process, and communicate their personal information through third-party services. It has also raised privacy issues regarding losing control over data, mass harvesting of information, and un-consented disclosure of personal content. Above all, the main concern is the lack of understanding about data privacy in cloud environments. Currently, the cloud service providers either advocate the principle of third-party doctrine and deny users' rights to protect their data stored in the cloud; or rely the notice-and-choice framework and present users with ambiguous, incomprehensible privacy statements without any meaningful privacy guarantee. In this regard, our research has three main contributions. First, to capture users' privacy expectations in cloud environments, we conceptually divide personal data into two categories, i.e., visible data and invisible data. The visible data refer to information users intentionally create, upload to, and share through the cloud; the invisible data refer to users' information retained in the cloud that is aggregated, analyzed, and repurposed without their knowledge or understanding. Second, to address users' privacy concerns raised by cloud computing, we propose two privacy protection frameworks, namely individual control and use limitation. The individual control framework emphasizes users' capability to govern the access to the visible data stored in the cloud. The use limitation framework emphasizes users' expectation to remain anonymous when the invisible data are aggregated and analyzed by cloud-based data services. Finally, we investigate various techniques to accommodate the new privacy protection frameworks, in the context of four cloud-based data services: personal health record sharing, location-based proximity test, link recommendation for social networks, and face tagging in photo management applications. For the first case, we develop a key-based protection technique to enforce fine-grained access control to users' digital health records. For the second case, we develop a key-less protection technique to achieve location-specific user selection. For latter two cases, we develop distributed learning algorithms to prevent large scale data harvesting. We further combine these algorithms with query regulation techniques to achieve user anonymity. The picture that is emerging from the above works is a bleak one. Regarding to personal data, the reality is we can no longer control them all. As communication technologies evolve, the scope of personal data has expanded beyond local, discrete silos, and integrated into the Internet. The traditional understanding of privacy must be updated to reflect these changes. In addition, because privacy is a particularly nuanced problem that is governed by context, there is no one-size-fit-all solution. While some cases can be salvaged either by cryptography or by other means, in others a rethinking of the trade-offs between utility and privacy appears to be necessary.},

  abstract = {We consider the privacy-preserving link prediction problem in decentralized online social network (OSNs). We formulate the problem as a sparse logistic regression problem and solve it with a novel decentralized two-tier method using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This method enables end users to collaborate with their online service providers without jeopardizing their data privacy. The method also grants end users fine-grained privacy control to their personal data by supporting arbitrary public/private data split. Using real-world data, we show that our method enjoys various advantages including high prediction accuracy, balanced workload, and limited communication overhead. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method copes well with link reconstruction attack.},

  abstract = {Personal health record (PHR) service is an emerging model for health information exchange. It allows patients to create, manage, control and share their health information with other users as well as healthcare providers. In reality, a PHR service is likely to be hosted by third-party cloud service providers in order to enhance its interoperability. However, there have been serious privacy concerns about outsourcing patients' PHR data to cloud servers, not only because cloud providers are generally not covered entities under HIPAA, but also due to an increasing number of cloud data breach incidents happened in recent years. In this thesis, we propose a privacy-preserving PHR system using attribute-based encryption (ABE). In this system, patients can encrypt their PHRs and store them on semi-trusted cloud servers such that servers do not have access to sensitive PHR contexts. Meanwhile patients maintain full control over access to their PHR files, by assigning fine-grained, attribute-based access privileges to selected data users, while different users can have access to different parts of their PHR. Our system also provides extra features such as populating PHR from professional electronic health record (EHR) using ABE. In order to evaluate our proposal, we create a Linux library that implement primitive of key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) algorithms. We also build a PHR application based on Indivo PCHR system that allow doctors to encrypt and submit their prescription and diagnostic note to PHR servers using KP-ABE. We evaluate the performance efficiency of different ABE schemes as well as the data query time of Indivo PCHR system when PHR data are encrypted under ABE scheme.},

  abstract = {Physical layer security for wireless communication is broadly considered as a promising approach to protect data confidentiality against eavesdroppers. However, despite its ample theoretical foundation, the transition to practical implementations of physical-layer security still lacks success. A close inspection of proven vulnerable physical-layer security designs reveals that the flaws are usually overlooked when the scheme is only evaluated against an inferior, single-antenna eavesdropper. Meanwhile, the attacks exposing vulnerabilities often lack theoretical justification. To reduce the gap between theory and practice, we posit that a physical-layer security scheme must be studied under multiple adversarial models to fully grasp its security strength. In this regard, we evaluate a specific physical-layer security scheme, i.e. orthogonal blinding, under multiple eavesdropper settings. We further propose a practical "ciphertext-only attack" that allows eavesdroppers to recover the original message by exploiting the low entropy fields in wireless packets. By means of simulation, we are able to reduce the symbol error rate at an eavesdropper below 1\% using only the eavesdropper's receiving data and a general knowledge about the format of the wireless packets.},

  abstract = {A location proximity test service allows mobile users to determine whether they are in close proximity to each other, and has found numerous applications in mobile social networks. Unfortunately, existing solutions usually reveal much of users' private location information during proximity test. They are also vulnerable to location cheating where an attacker reports false locations to gain advantage. Moreover, the initial trust establishment among unfamiliar users in large scale mobile social networks has been a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that enables a user to perform (1) privacy-preserving proximity test without revealing her actual location to the server or other users not within the proximity, and (2) secure handshake that establishes secure communications among stranger users within the proximity who do not have pre-shared secret. The proposed scheme is based on a novel concept, i.e. location tags, and we put forward a location tag construction method using environmental signals that provides location unforgeability. Bloom filters are used to represent the location tags efficiently and a fuzzy extractor is exploited to extract shared secrets between matching location tags. Our solution also allows users to tune their desired location privacy level and range of proximity. We conduct extensive analysis and real experiments to demonstrate the feasibility, security, and efficiency of our scheme.},
