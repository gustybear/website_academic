  abstract = {This demonstration shows the beam steering capability of a new liquid metal-based intelligent reflective surface (IRS) that operates at the 5.9 GHz frequency band to enhance signal coverage of cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X) communication. The IRS unit cell design leverages the electrical actuation technique to move a liquid metal droplet within a rectangle-shaped microfluidic channel filled with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which changes the phase and magnitude of the reflection signal, and relies on the liquid metal's high surface tension in NaOH to maintain the droplet position without further energy consumption. A power-efficient sequential control logic with priority over center IRS elements is implemented to promptly steer the reflection beam toward the desired angle before the entire IRS panel is fully configured. The merits of the design are evaluated under a 5.9GHz SISO C-V2X link implemented with a software-defined radio.},

The Channel State Information (CSI) provided through the channel estimation process enables the capture of fine-grained information on scatterers in the environment to discern minute physiological motion, such as heartbeat. This work presents the first heart signal detection via CSI from a millimeter-wave Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. Trade-offs between using CSI amplitude and phase and the impact of frequency diversity are analyzed theoretically and confirmed experimentally using a 28 GHz OFDM communications system. Heart rates were successfully detected for three human subjects within 6\% of photoplethysmography (PPG) reference, with clear benefits of frequency diversity among OFDM subcarriers.},

  abstract = {Wireless communications systems provide channel state information (CSI), which can be used to characterize the physical propagation environment. The small physiological motion of human subjects in that environment, such as that associated with respiration, can modulate the CSI, thus allowing wireless physiological sensing through which a communications system detects and monitors cardiopulmonary motion. NextG millimeter-wave communications systems present even greater opportunities for wireless physiological sensing due to the advantages of small wavelength and high directionality. But challenges also arise due to the multipath effect and phase aliasing caused by larger-than-wavelength motion displacement. This work introduces a comprehensive mathematical CSI model to accurately characterize physiological motion captured by the amplitude and phase of the CSI of a millimeter-wave communications system. The model allows for the interpretation of intricate CSI pattern variations to avoid aliasing error and has been validated with experiments involving both parametric measures conducted with a robotic mover and respiration rate measurements for human subjects. In all cases, rate measurements could be consistently resolved within 10\%, or 0.02 Hz, demonstrating the potential for incorporating physiological sensing in NextG millimeter-wave communications systems.},

  abstract = {At-home screening systems for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can bring convenience to remote chronic disease management. However, the unsupervised home environment is subject to cheating from a non-compliant user, either by using another person to substitute for the test or manipulating the data communication during the test, which lowers the credibility of at-home OSA screening. To improve trustworthiness, this work presents SIENNA, an insider-resistant breathing-based authentication/pairing protocol. SIENNA leverages the uniqueness of breathing patterns to automatically authenticate a user and pairs two main components of an OSA kit, e.g., a mobile OSA app and a physiological monitoring radar system (PRMS). SIENNA does not require biometric enrollment and instead transforms the respiratory belt measurements taken during the user's routine physical checkup into breathing biometrics comparable with the PRMS readings. Furthermore, it can operate within a noisy multi-target home environment and is secure against a co-located attacker through the usage of JADE-ICA, fuzzy commitment, and friendly jamming. We fully implemented SIENNA and evaluated its performance with medium-scale trials. Results show that SIENNA can achieve reliable ({$>$} 90\textbackslash\% success rate) user authentication and secure device pairing in a noisy environment against an attacker with full knowledge of the authorized user's breathing biometrics.},

  abstract = {Non-contact vital signs monitoring using microwave Doppler radar has shown great promise in healthcare applications. Recently, this unobtrusive form of physiological sensing has also been gaining attention for its potential for continuous identity authentication, which can reduce the vulnerability of traditional one-pass validation authentication systems. Physiological Doppler radar is an attractive approach for continuous identity authentication as it requires neither contact nor line-of-sight and does not give rise to privacy concerns associated with video imaging. This paper presents a review of recent advances in radar-based identity authentication systems. It includes an evaluation of the applicability of different research efforts in authentication using respiratory patterns and heart-based dynamics. It also identifies aspects of future research required to address remaining challenges in applying unobtrusive respiration-based or heart-based identity authentication to practical systems. With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, radar-based continuous authentication can grow to serve a wide range of valuable functions in society.},

At an operating frequency of 3.5 GHz, the IRS redirects an incoming signal at normal incidence to 34°. A testbed is developed that allows us to test the quality of periodic motion (i.e. simulate breathing). The transmit horn is pointed at a metallic target that is oscillating at 0.2 Hz, where the target scatters the transmitted signal. The scattered signal will reach the IRS, which then redirects the signal to the receive horn. The setup was tested for three possible cases, with an IRS, a copper plate, and an absorber as the target. The merits of implementing an IRS in physiological sensing are discussed and evaluated.},

  abstract = {Personal health record (PHR) is an emerging patient-centric model of health information exchange, which is often outsourced to be stored at a third party, such as cloud providers. However, there have been wide privacy concerns as personal health information could be exposed to those third party servers and to unauthorized parties. To assure the patients’ control over access to their own PHRs, it is a promising method to encrypt the PHRs before outsourcing. Yet, issues such as risks of privacy exposure, scalability in key management, flexible access, and efficient user revocation, have remained the most important challenges toward achieving fine-grained, cryptographically enforced data access control. In this paper, we propose a novel patient-centric framework and a suite of mechanisms for data access control to PHRs stored in semitrusted servers. To achieve fine-grained and scalable data access control for PHRs, we leverage attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques to encrypt each patient’s PHR file. Different from previous works in secure data outsourcing, we focus on the multiple data owner scenario, and divide the users in the PHR system into multiple security domains that greatly reduces the key management complexity for owners and users. A high degree of patient privacy is guaranteed simultaneously by exploiting multiauthority ABE. Our scheme also enables dynamic modification of access policies or file attributes, supports efficient on-demand user/attribute revocation and break-glass access under emergency scenarios. Extensive analytical and experimental results are presented which show the security, scalability, and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract = {Building occupancy information is significant for a variety of reasons, from allocation of resources in smart buildings to responding during emergency situations. As most people spend more than 90\% of their time indoors, a comfortable indoor environment is crucial. To ensure comfort, traditional HVAC systems condition rooms assuming maximum occupancy, accounting for more than 50\% of buildings’ energy budgets in the US. Occupancy level is a key factor in ensuring energy efficiency, as occupancy-controlled HVAC systems can reduce energy waste by conditioning rooms based on actual usage. Numerous studies have focused on developing occupancy estimation models leveraging existing sensors, with camera-based methods gaining popularity due to their high precision and widespread availability. However, the main concern with using cameras for occupancy estimation is the potential violation of occupants’ privacy. Unlike previous video-/image-based occupancy estimation methods, we addressed the issue of occupants’ privacy in this work by proposing and investigating both motion-based and motion-independent occupancy counting methods on intentionally blurred video frames. Our proposed approach included the development of a motion-based technique that inherently preserves privacy, as well as motion-independent techniques such as detection-based and density-estimation-based methods. To improve the accuracy of the motion-independent approaches, we utilized deblurring methods: an iterative statistical technique and a deep-learning-based method. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of the privacy implications of our motion-independent occupancy counting system by comparing the original, blurred, and deblurred frames using different image quality assessment metrics. This analysis provided insights into the trade-off between occupancy estimation accuracy and the preservation of occupants’ visual privacy. The combination of iterative statistical deblurring and density estimation achieved a 16.29\% counting error, outperforming our other proposed approaches while preserving occupants’ visual privacy to a certain extent. Our multifaceted approach aims to contribute to the field of occupancy estimation by proposing a solution that seeks to balance the trade-off between accuracy and privacy. While further research is needed to fully address this complex issue, our work provides insights and a step towards a more privacy-aware occupancy estimation system.},

  abstract = {Advanced botnets adopt a peer-to-peer (P2P) infrastructure for more resilient command and control (C\&C). Traditional detection techniques become less effective in identifying bots that communicate via a P2P structure. In this paper, we present PeerClean, a novel system that detects P2P botnets in real time using only high-level features extracted from C\&C network flow traffic. PeerClean reliably distinguishes P2P bot-infected hosts from legitimate P2P hosts by jointly considering flow-level traffic statistics and network connection patterns. Instead of working on individual connections or hosts, PeerClean clusters hosts with similar flow traffic statistics into groups. It then extracts the collective and dynamic connection patterns of each group by leveraging a novel dynamic group behavior analysis. Comparing with the individual host-level connection patterns, the collective group patterns are more robust and differentiable. Multi-class classification models are then used to identify different types of bots based on the established patterns. To increase the detection probability, we further propose to train the model with average group behavior, but to explore the extreme group behavior for the detection. We evaluate PeerClean on real-world flow records from a campus network. Our evaluation shows that PeerClean is able to achieve high detection rates with few false positives.},

  abstract = {With the accelerating adaption of Cloud and Edge computing, cloud-based networked deployment emerges to enable providers to deliver services in a cost-effective and elastic manner. However, security concern remains one of the major obstacles to its wider adaption. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) has been advocated to protect cloud services in an isolated execution environment. In this paper, we present a new genre of side-channel attack called interface-based side-channel attack and demonstrate its effectiveness on the TEE-assisted networked service system. The root cause of this attack is the input-dependent interface invocation (e.g., interface information and invocation patterns) that can be observed by untrusted software to reveal the control flows inside the enclave. Our evaluation demonstrates that the attack can effectively re-identify encrypted web pages processed in the SGX enclave with an accuracy of 87.6\% and a recall of 76.6\%, and can reduce the search domain of the 1024 bits RSA private keys to 1.69×10−6 of the original search domain. As countermeasures, we propose, implement and evaluate a set of static analysis tools to mitigate the newly discovered threats. The key idea is to use inter-procedural dataflow analysis to identify potential leakage via the interface, and then mitigate them during compilation using techniques including branch obfuscation, loop obfuscation, and constant size wrapper.},
