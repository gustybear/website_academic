abstract: Non-contact vital signs monitoring using microwave Doppler radar has shown
  great promise in healthcare applications. Recently, this unobtrusive form of physiological
  sensing has also been gaining attention for its potential for continuous identity
  authentication, which can reduce the vulnerability of traditional one-pass validation
  authentication systems. Physiological Doppler radar is an attractive approach for
  continuous identity authentication as it requires neither contact nor line-of-sight
  and does not give rise to privacy concerns associated with video imaging. This paper
  presents a review of recent advances in radar-based identity authentication systems.
  It includes an evaluation of the applicability of different research efforts in
  authentication using respiratory patterns and heart-based dynamics. It also identifies
  aspects of future research required to address remaining challenges in applying
  unobtrusive respiration-based or heart-based identity authentication to practical
  systems. With the advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence, radar-based
  continuous authentication can grow to serve a wide range of valuable functions in
  society.
