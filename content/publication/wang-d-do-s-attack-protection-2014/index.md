abstract: Cloud computing has become the real trend of enterprise IT service model
  that offers cost-effective and scalable processing. Meanwhile, Software-Defined
  Networking (SDN) is gaining popularity in enterprise networks for flexibility in
  network management service and reduced operational cost. There seems a trend for
  the two technologies to go hand-in-hand in providing an enterprise's IT services.
  However, the new challenges brought by the marriage of cloud computing and SDN,
  particularly the implications on enterprise network security, have not been well
  understood. This paper sets to address this important problem. We start by examining
  the security impact, in particular, the impact on DDoS attack defense mechanisms,
  in an enterprise network where both technologies are adopted. We find that SDN technology
  can actually help enterprises to defend against DDoS attacks if the defense architecture
  is designed properly. To that end, we propose a DDoS attack mitigation architecture
  that integrates a highly programmable network monitoring to enable attack detection
  and a flexible control structure to allow fast and specific attack reaction. The
  simulation results show that our architecture can effectively and efficiently address
  the security challenges brought by the new network paradigm.
