abstract: The rapid proliferation of personal wearable as well as embedded devices
  point to the emergence of networks of unprecedented size and complexity in the near
  future. Unfortunately, traditional network security solutions fall short of addressing
  the unique security requirements of the emerging environment given their general
  emphasis on administratively managed, preconfigured security context and strong
  physical security mechanisms. To cope with the security challenges of this emerging
  environment, novel cognitive-inspired security architectures have been proposed
  that emphasize dynamic, autonomous trust management. Cognitive security systems
  take advantage of sensing and computing capabilities of smart devices to analyze
  raw sensor data and apply machine learning techniques to make security decisions.
  In this article, we present a canonical representation of cognitive security architectures
  and examine the practicality of using these architectures to address the security
  challenges of rapidly growing networks of mobile/embedded autonomous devices including
  the ability to identify threats simply based on symptoms, without necessarily understanding
  attack methods. Using authentication as the main focus, we introduce our canonical
  representation and define various categories of contextual information commonly
  used by cognitive security architectures to handle authentication requirements,
  and highlight key advantages and disadvantages of each category. We then examine
  three grand challenges facing the cognitive security research including the tension
  between automation and security, the unintended consequences of using machine learning
  techniques as a basis for making security decisions, and the revocation problem
  in the context of cognitive security. We conclude by offering some insight into
  solution approaches to these challenges.
