abstract: The development of technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT)
  provides a new perspective on applications pertaining to smart cities. Smart city
  applications focus on resolving issues facing people in everyday life, and have
  attracted a considerable amount of research interest. The typical issue encountered
  in such places of daily use, such as stations, shopping malls, and stadiums is crowd
  dynamics management. Therefore, we focus on crowd dynamics management to resolve
  the problem of congestion using IoT technologies. Real-time crowd dynamics management
  can be achieved by gathering information relating to congestion and propose less
  crowded places. Although many crowd dynamics management applications have been proposed
  in various scenarios and many models have been devised to this end, a general model
  for evaluating the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management has not yet
  been developed in IoT research. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model to
  evaluate the performance of crowd dynamics management applications. In other words,
  the objective of this paper is to present the proof-of-concept of control effectiveness
  of crowd dynamics management. Our model uses feedback control theory, and enables
  an integrated evaluation of the control effectiveness of crowd dynamics management
  methods under various scenarios. We also provide extensive numerical results to
  verify the effectiveness of the model.
