  abstract = {With the accelerating adaption of Cloud and Edge computing, cloud-based networked deployment emerges to enable providers to deliver services in a cost-effective and elastic manner. However, security concern remains one of the major obstacles to its wider adaption. Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) has been advocated to protect cloud services in an isolated execution environment. In this paper, we present a new genre of side-channel attack called interface-based side-channel attack and demonstrate its effectiveness on the TEE-assisted networked service system. The root cause of this attack is the input-dependent interface invocation (e.g., interface information and invocation patterns) that can be observed by untrusted software to reveal the control flows inside the enclave. Our evaluation demonstrates that the attack can effectively re-identify encrypted web pages processed in the SGX enclave with an accuracy of 87.6\% and a recall of 76.6\%, and can reduce the search domain of the 1024 bits RSA private keys to 1.69×10−6 of the original search domain. As countermeasures, we propose, implement and evaluate a set of static analysis tools to mitigate the newly discovered threats. The key idea is to use inter-procedural dataflow analysis to identify potential leakage via the interface, and then mitigate them during compilation using techniques including branch obfuscation, loop obfuscation, and constant size wrapper.},
