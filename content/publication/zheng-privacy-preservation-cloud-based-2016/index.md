abstract: "Data privacy is a globally recognized human right for individuals to control\
  \ the access to their personal information, and bar the negative consequences from\
  \ the use of this information. As communication technologies progress, the means\
  \ to protect data privacy must also evolve to address new challenges come into view.\
  \ Our research goal in this dissertation is to develop privacy protection frameworks\
  \ and techniques suitable for the emerging cloud-based data services, in particular\
  \ privacy-preserving algorithms and protocols for the cloud-based data sharing and\
  \ data analytics services. Cloud computing has enabled users to store, process,\
  \ and communicate their personal information through third-party services. It has\
  \ also raised privacy issues regarding losing control over data, mass harvesting\
  \ of information, and un-consented disclosure of personal content. Above all, the\
  \ main concern is the lack of understanding about data privacy in cloud environments.\
  \ Currently, the cloud service providers either advocate the principle of third-party\
  \ doctrine and deny users' rights to protect their data stored in the cloud; or\
  \ rely the notice-and-choice framework and present users with ambiguous, incomprehensible\
  \ privacy statements without any meaningful privacy guarantee. In this regard, our\
  \ research has three main contributions. First, to capture users' privacy expectations\
  \ in cloud environments, we conceptually divide personal data into two categories,\
  \ i.e., visible data and invisible data. The visible data refer to information users\
  \ intentionally create, upload to, and share through the cloud; the invisible data\
  \ refer to users' information retained in the cloud that is aggregated, analyzed,\
  \ and repurposed without their knowledge or understanding. Second, to address users'\
  \ privacy concerns raised by cloud computing, we propose two privacy protection\
  \ frameworks, namely individual control and use limitation. The individual control\
  \ framework emphasizes users' capability to govern the access to the visible data\
  \ stored in the cloud. The use limitation framework emphasizes users' expectation\
  \ to remain anonymous when the invisible data are aggregated and analyzed by cloud-based\
  \ data services. Finally, we investigate various techniques to accommodate the new\
  \ privacy protection frameworks, in the context of four cloud-based data services:\
  \ personal health record sharing, location-based proximity test, link recommendation\
  \ for social networks, and face tagging in photo management applications. For the\
  \ first case, we develop a key-based protection technique to enforce fine-grained\
  \ access control to users' digital health records. For the second case, we develop\
  \ a key-less protection technique to achieve location-specific user selection. For\
  \ latter two cases, we develop distributed learning algorithms to prevent large\
  \ scale data harvesting. We further combine these algorithms with query regulation\
  \ techniques to achieve user anonymity. The picture that is emerging from the above\
  \ works is a bleak one. Regarding to personal data, the reality is we can no longer\
  \ control them all. As communication technologies evolve, the scope of personal\
  \ data has expanded beyond local, discrete silos, and integrated into the Internet.\
  \ The traditional understanding of privacy must be updated to reflect these changes.\
  \ In addition, because privacy is a particularly nuanced problem that is governed\
  \ by context, there is no one-size-fit-all solution. While some cases can be salvaged\
  \ either by cryptography or by other means, in others a rethinking of the trade-offs\
  \ between utility and privacy appears to be necessary."
