abstract: The increasingly sophisticated at-home screening systems for obstructive
  sleep apnea (OSA), integrated with both contactless and contact-based sensing modalities,
  bring convenience and reliability to remote chronic disease management. However,
  the device pairing processes between system components are vulnerable to wireless
  exploitation from a non-compliant user wishing to manipulate the test results. This
  work presents SIENNA, an insider-resistant context-based pairing protocol. SIENNA
  leverages JADE-ICA to uniquely identify a user's respiration pattern within a multi-person
  environment and fuzzy commitment for automatic device pairing, while using friendly
  jamming technique to prevents an insider with knowledge of respiration patterns
  from acquiring the pairing key. Our analysis and test results show that SIENNA can
  achieve reliable ($>$ 90% success rate) device pairing under a noisy environment
  and is robust against the attacker with full knowledge of the context information.
