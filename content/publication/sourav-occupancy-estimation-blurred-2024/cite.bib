  abstract = {Building occupancy information is significant for a variety of reasons, from allocation of resources in smart buildings to responding during emergency situations. As most people spend more than 90\% of their time indoors, a comfortable indoor environment is crucial. To ensure comfort, traditional HVAC systems condition rooms assuming maximum occupancy, accounting for more than 50\% of buildings’ energy budgets in the US. Occupancy level is a key factor in ensuring energy efficiency, as occupancy-controlled HVAC systems can reduce energy waste by conditioning rooms based on actual usage. Numerous studies have focused on developing occupancy estimation models leveraging existing sensors, with camera-based methods gaining popularity due to their high precision and widespread availability. However, the main concern with using cameras for occupancy estimation is the potential violation of occupants’ privacy. Unlike previous video-/image-based occupancy estimation methods, we addressed the issue of occupants’ privacy in this work by proposing and investigating both motion-based and motion-independent occupancy counting methods on intentionally blurred video frames. Our proposed approach included the development of a motion-based technique that inherently preserves privacy, as well as motion-independent techniques such as detection-based and density-estimation-based methods. To improve the accuracy of the motion-independent approaches, we utilized deblurring methods: an iterative statistical technique and a deep-learning-based method. Furthermore, we conducted an analysis of the privacy implications of our motion-independent occupancy counting system by comparing the original, blurred, and deblurred frames using different image quality assessment metrics. This analysis provided insights into the trade-off between occupancy estimation accuracy and the preservation of occupants’ visual privacy. The combination of iterative statistical deblurring and density estimation achieved a 16.29\% counting error, outperforming our other proposed approaches while preserving occupants’ visual privacy to a certain extent. Our multifaceted approach aims to contribute to the field of occupancy estimation by proposing a solution that seeks to balance the trade-off between accuracy and privacy. While further research is needed to fully address this complex issue, our work provides insights and a step towards a more privacy-aware occupancy estimation system.},
