abstract: We consider the privacy-preserving link prediction problem in decentralized
  online social network (OSNs). We formulate the problem as a sparse logistic regression
  problem and solve it with a novel decentralized two-tier method using alternating
  direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This method enables end users to collaborate
  with their online service providers without jeopardizing their data privacy. The
  method also grants end users fine-grained privacy control to their personal data
  by supporting arbitrary public/private data split. Using real-world data, we show
  that our method enjoys various advantages including high prediction accuracy, balanced
  workload, and limited communication overhead. Additionally, we demonstrate that
  our method copes well with link reconstruction attack.
