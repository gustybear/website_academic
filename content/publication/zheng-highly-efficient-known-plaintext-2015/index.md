abstract: In this letter, we describe highly effective known-plaintext attacks against
  physical layer security schemes. We substantially reduce the amount of required
  known-plaintext symbols and lower the symbol error rate (SER) for the attacker.
  In particular, we analyze the security of orthogonal blinding schemes that disturb
  an eavesdropper's signal reception using artificial noise transmission. We improve
  the attack efficacy using fast converging optimization algorithms and combining
  the measurements of neighboring subchannels in a multicarrier system. We implement
  the enhanced attack algorithms by solving unregularized and regularized least squares
  problems. By means of simulation, we show that the performance of the new attack
  algorithms supersedes the normalized least mean square approach discussed in the
  work of Schulz et al., e.g., by lowering the eavesdropper's SER by 82% while using
  95% less known plaintext.
