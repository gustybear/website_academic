abstract: An incipient population of Coconut Rhinoceros Beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros)
  was discovered on the island of Oahu in late 2013, posing a significant threat to
  the iconic palm trees and on the verge of migrating onto the other Hawaiian Islands
  and US Mainland. CRB surveillance and capture with traps deployed in remote and
  undeveloped areas are critical to contain and eradicate these invasive insects,
  but manual monitoring is laborious and resource-intensive. To improve the program's
  scalability, we are developing machine vision tools for trap-based surveillance
  systems to enable automatic CRB detection and UAV-based aerial imagery systems to
  allow automatic detection and characterization of CRB damage to palm trees. Both
  cloud-based and edge-based architectures are considered. The evaluations show that
  communication of trap images to a domain and inferencing on the cloud using effective
  ConvNets like MobileNet with Transfer learning for beetle detection is highly accurate
  (99%) but bandwidth-intensive. Alternatively, an inference made locally on limited
  microcontroller memory using TensorFlow Lite, with inference results communicated
  through low data rate radio transmission, demonstrates reduced but acceptable detection
  accuracy (80 to 90%) in the current prototypes. We plan to implement the latter
  approach on distributed wireless networks to automate CRB trap surveillance and
  analysis in remote areas.
