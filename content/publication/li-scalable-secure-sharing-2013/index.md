abstract: Personal health record (PHR) is an emerging patient-centric model of health
  information exchange, which is often outsourced to be stored at a third party, such
  as cloud providers. However, there have been wide privacy concerns as personal health
  information could be exposed to those third party servers and to unauthorized parties.
  To assure the patients' control over access to their own PHRs, it is a promising
  method to encrypt the PHRs before outsourcing. Yet, issues such as risks of privacy
  exposure, scalability in key management, flexible access, and efficient user revocation,
  have remained the most important challenges toward achieving fine-grained, cryptographically
  enforced data access control. In this paper, we propose a novel patient-centric
  framework and a suite of mechanisms for data access control to PHRs stored in semitrusted
  servers. To achieve fine-grained and scalable data access control for PHRs, we leverage
  attribute-based encryption (ABE) techniques to encrypt each patient's PHR file.
  Different from previous works in secure data outsourcing, we focus on the multiple
  data owner scenario, and divide the users in the PHR system into multiple security
  domains that greatly reduces the key management complexity for owners and users.
  A high degree of patient privacy is guaranteed simultaneously by exploiting multiauthority
  ABE. Our scheme also enables dynamic modification of access policies or file attributes,
  supports efficient on-demand user/attribute revocation and break-glass access under
  emergency scenarios. Extensive analytical and experimental results are presented
  which show the security, scalability, and efficiency of our proposed scheme.
