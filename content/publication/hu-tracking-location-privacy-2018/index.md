abstract: The online advertising ecosystem is built upon the massive data collection
  of ad networks to learn the properties of users for targeted ad deliveries. Existing
  efforts have investigated the privacy leakage behaviors of mobile ad networks. However,
  there lacks a large-scale measurement study to evaluate the scale of privacy leakage
  through mobile ads. In this work, we present a study of the potential privacy leakage
  in location-based mobile advertising services based on a large-scale measurement.
  We first introduce a threat model in the mobile ad ecosystem, and then design a
  measurement system to perform extensive threat measurements and assessments. To
  counteract the privacy leakage threats, we design and implement an adaptive location
  obfuscation mechanism, which can be used to obfuscate location data in real-time
  while minimizing the impact to mobile ad businesses.
