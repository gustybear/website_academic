abstract: This demonstration shows the beam steering capability of a new liquid metal-based
  intelligent reflective surface (IRS) that operates at the 5.9 GHz frequency band
  to enhance signal coverage of cellular vehicular-to-everything (C-V2X) communication.
  The IRS unit cell design leverages the electrical actuation technique to move a
  liquid metal droplet within a rectangle-shaped microfluidic channel filled with
  sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which changes the phase and magnitude of the reflection
  signal, and relies on the liquid metal's high surface tension in NaOH to maintain
  the droplet position without further energy consumption. A power-efficient sequential
  control logic with priority over center IRS elements is implemented to promptly
  steer the reflection beam toward the desired angle before the entire IRS panel is
  fully configured. The merits of the design are evaluated under a 5.9GHz SISO C-V2X
  link implemented with a software-defined radio.
