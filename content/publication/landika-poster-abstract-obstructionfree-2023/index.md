abstract: This poster abstract shows the possibilities of incorporating an Intelligent
  Reflective Surface (IRS) that operates at the 3.5 GHz band in order to enhance signal
  coverage and perform obstruction-free physiological motion sensing. At an operating
  frequency of 3.5 GHz, the IRS redirects an incoming signal at normal incidence to
  34Â°. A testbed is developed that allows us to test the quality of periodic motion
  (i.e. simulate breathing). The transmit horn is pointed at a metallic target that
  is oscillating at 0.2 Hz, where the target scatters the transmitted signal. The
  scattered signal will reach the IRS, which then redirects the signal to the receive
  horn. The setup was tested for three possible cases, with an IRS, a copper plate,
  and an absorber as the target. The merits of implementing an IRS in physiological
  sensing are discussed and evaluated.
