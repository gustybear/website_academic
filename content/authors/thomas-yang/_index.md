I am currently an undergraduate student going into my fourth semester of Computer Engineering. I am interested in dealing with big data and AI, with a particular interest in self-learning AI. I am expected to graduate in Fall 2020, and am planning to pursue a Masters Degree in Computer Engineering, with a focus on machine learning.
